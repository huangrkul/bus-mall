# Bus-Mall
Class 201 Week 3 Project

## Day 1 branch - lab11-busmall
- Implemented dynamic products display so it can be any number of images.
- All products currently / previously displayed do not repeat.
- Views and Clicked products are tracked and displayed at the end as a list.
- Default 25 rounds of tries have been implemented.
- After 25 rounds, the products will no longer be clickable.

## Day 2 branch - lab12-chartjs
- Implement chart for BusMall using chart.js
- Refactored the code so that empty list and chart will be generated at the start.
- Once user is done with the app, the list and chart will be populated accordingly.
- Added additional styling across the page.
- Added product image preload in init() to prevent flickering during image swap (caused by image load).
