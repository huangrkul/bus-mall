# User Stories - Problem Domain
To make this market analysis maximally effective, BusMall wants you to build an app that displays potential products to individuals in focus groups (three products at a time, side-by-side-by-side) so you’ll need to manage the size and the aspect ratio of the images and perhaps edit them a bit; Mac users can do this in Preview (very cool!), plus, there are lots of online tools.

The app’s purpose is to have the group members choose which product, of the three displayed images, that they would be most likely to purchase, and then store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data.

To keep the product selection process as untainted as possible, you have been instructed to not allow any results to be shown to users until there have been a total of 25 selections made.

The marketing team is not only interested in the total number of clicks, but also the percentage of times that an item was clicked when it was shown. So, you’ll also need to keep track of how many times each image is displayed and do the calculations.

# User Stories - Instruction
Part of your assignment today is to write your own user stories. Be sure to consider the multiple roles involved: the marketing research team, the developer, and the focus group participant who will be using the application. Try to write 4-5 user stories for each role. DO THIS STEP FIRST in a file called user_stories.md. The commit logs in your repo will have a first couple of commits for the scaffolding process, but next you should have a ‘user stories’ commit that is in place before any code is written.  

As a reminder, user stories typically take the form of, “As X, I want Y, so that Z” but do not necessarily need that structure.  

## User Stories - MARKETING RESEARCH TEAM
- I want to see the popularity of each product so I know which product should have more exposure in the design.
- I want to see a complete data analysis of the app so I can better understand how to present the products.
- I want to see if there is a pattern to what participants like so we can add similar products onto the list in the future.
## User Stories - THE DEVELOPERS
- I want to make sure the app is extremely UX / UI friendly so that both marketing team and participants will have a good experience.
- I want to make sure the app is built to spec per marketing team's requests so the output data is exactly what they wanted.
## User Stories = FOCUS GROUP
- As participant, I want to see
